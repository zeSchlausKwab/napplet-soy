Embed small assets; retrieve external byte resources only through napplet.resource.\n- No CDN imports, direct fetch/WebSockets, service workers, forms, popups, or parent-window access. Use host-mediated NAP APIs for resources and Nostr reads.\n- Host domains are injected before your scripts run. Check window.napplet?.resource (or the relevant domain) for optional capabilities. Declare mandatory domains in napplet.json requires.\n- The player is an opaque sandbox. Use napplet.storage instead of localStorage. Listen to napplet.identity.onChanged when retaining account data in memory.\n- Use napplet.resource for assets, napplet.relay/outbox for reads, and napplet.fs for session files. Relays in napplet.json are fallback read destinations. Explicit public WSS hints are supported through the host; private/LAN relays are denied except explicitly configured literal-loopback WS in local preview; publishing/signing calls remain denied by the playback policy.\n- Use canvas, inline SVG, DOM, Web Audio after a user gesture, or embedded data URLs.\n- Keep the package under 10 MiB. Support pointer and touch; respect reduced motion where practical.\n- Run soyli dev for the same restricted preview runtime as napplet.soy. The preview and browser checks are provided by the installed CLI; no Bun or Node installation is needed.\n- Preserve license notices and credit when remixing. Never place private signing keys in this project.\n\nRead docs/napplet-space.md for the installed skills and this legacy single-file workflow. Ask what the creator wants to make, then start with a small visible change.\n`,

The preview reloads when the artifact changes. No dependency install or separate Bun/Node runtime is required. Install the CLI from https://napplet.soy/create if needed. Git and an unlocked OS credential store are used for publishing; soyli doctor checks prerequisites.\n\nThe preview uses the same hash verification, srcdoc sandbox, pinned shim, and host services as the website. Use the injected domains; optional domains may be absent. \`requires\` declares mandatory domains; \`relays\` configures fallback relay reads and \`servers\` supplies Blossom resource hints. Empty lists work for self-contained experiments. You can connect your browser extension to test identity changes; the preview never signs or publishes events.\n\nThe local \`previewId\` scopes your saves and is not a Nostr identity. Local bytes are trusted as your editable source and verified by hash in the browser; signature verification applies once a manifest is published. Files offered by napplet.fs stay in the preview session until you download them.\n\nEdit the optional lowercase topic labels in \`napplet.json\` as your idea evolves. They describe the creation, for example \`visual\`, \`generative\`, or \`game\`; they are not exclusive categories.\n\nThe HTML is both the source and playable artifact. Keep it self-contained. Creator identities are managed by the platform CLI account commands. The selected creator and publication targets are in ignored .napplet-space/project.json as public configuration; keys and remote-signer credentials stay in your OS credential store. This public reference never authorizes a clone or remix to use another creator’s signer. Use \`soyli publish --dry-run\` to inspect the source and destinations, then make a reviewed Git checkpoint with soyli checkpoint before publishing. Code and pushed Git history are public by default. Git-backed remixes can use soyli propose to send changes upstream, and maintainers use soyli review to inspect and play them. Add --network local to use the dev services. The publisher keeps frozen source and retry state in .napplet-space; keep that directory when moving the project. Publication returns a portable Nostr address and reports when the website has indexed it. Friendly named links are optional and do not affect public interoperability.\n`,
