              The screenshot is a PNG; the optional clip is a short, silent WebM. Both are selected
              in <code>napplet.json</code>. Review them before your next checkpoint. Existing files
              are preserved: use a new name such as <code>soyli screenshot preview-2.png</code> for
              another capture.
            </p>
            <p>
              A changed build needs a fresh clip, or you can remove <code>preview.video</code>.
              Without a selected cover, publication captures one automatically. A deliberately
              chosen scene usually makes a better first impression.

            <h3>Sounds, images, fonts and other files</h3>
            <p>
              Keep small assets in <code>src/assets/</code> and import them through the starter’s
              build, for example <code>import imageUrl from './assets/player.png?url'</code>. CSS
              font URLs work too. The single-file build embeds them in the finished HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simply dropping a file next to the napplet or using a <code>/assets/…</code> path does
              not make it available after publication. Larger external resources need the supported
              resource/media capabilities and their declared requirements. See the{' '}

              Read the generated <code>docs/napplet-backend.md</code> with your coding agent.
              Declare scoreboards and required capabilities, then use <code>soyli dev</code> for
              isolated local backend data. Preview scores do not go to the public board.

              soyLI 0.16.0 adds a Controller tester to the workshop. Pair a USB or Bluetooth
              controller, open the tester, click inside it and press a controller button. Inspect
              buttons and sticks, adjust dead zones and try a mapping in the napplet sandbox.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask your agent to add controller support using{' '}
              <code>docs/napplet-controllers.md</code> and the bundled input helper. Existing
              projects receive them through <code>soyli skills update</code>. Your game connects the
              controls to its actions and keeps keyboard and touch alternatives. No account or
              backend is needed for input.
