# NAP concepts and expansion review

Reviewed **2026-09-14** for upstream concept and interoperability review before wider launch.
This records an upstream reading and code comparison, not a completed conformance
audit. The [compatibility inventory](COMPATIBILITY.md) now records the configuration
milestone and actual test coverage. The site is already deployed; the remaining acceptance work precedes a wider
launch. The user's decision that the NIP-5D proposal has authority still applies.

Registry status is not a statement that our runtime implements a capability. Open
proposal status is not itself a reason to reject the user's selected contract.
Recheck and pin the concrete proposal, shim, SDK, starter and conformance suite
together when implementing an affected capability.

## Concepts to preserve

The [registry](https://github.com/napplet/naps/blob/a040914b4bbd3a5cd8a14b0f316a723c968ebfb2/README.md)
separates these concepts:

- A NAP defines a runtime capability contract; a projection supplies its transport.
- Domains identify capabilities. NAP-SHELL supplies the foundational handshake;
  other capabilities are optional, with dependencies and discoverable support.
- Archetypes describe roles; they are distinct from capability APIs and topic tags.
- Conventions describe shared message semantics, separately from archetypes and NAPs.
- Composition belongs to the host. Self-contained creations can remain valid without
  implementing cross-napplet interaction.

The [web projection](https://github.com/napplet/naps/blob/a040914b4bbd3a5cd8a14b0f316a723c968ebfb2/projections/web.md)
uses opaque sandboxed frames, host-bound message sources and `window.napplet` domain
surfaces. Keep signing, payment authority and provider transport in the trusted host.
Future route/flavor/room conventions should preserve stable identities and validated
payloads; URL presentation must not become a second protocol identity.

The overview mentions manifest kind 35128, while our pinned NIP-5D implementation
uses 35129/15129/5129. Record the layer and revision behind each statement; do not
replace deployed identities based on a general overview. The current proposal head
was rechecked and still matches our NIP-5D pin; no kind migration is needed. The
host-owned injection/handshake decision is recorded in the compatibility matrix. This disagreement
was also identified in [earlier research](RESEARCH.md).

## What the current code actually exposes

2026-09-15 media update: reviewed [NAP-MEDIA PR 10 at 2b2d29e90c30b994bf5035a65b57e5fe7f08a9a2](https://github.com/napplet/naps/blob/2b2d29e90c30b994bf5035a65b57e5fe7f08a9a2/naps/NAP-MEDIA.md)
against shim 0.30.0 and starter SDK 0.24.4. The shared host now adds a bounded
shell-owned audio subset. Use the proposal's detailed Wire Protocol table, matching
the installed shim's three-part session names, rather than its conflicting API-table
spellings. No upstream package, NIP-5D kind or iframe permission is changed.
Owner/source subsets are explicitly permitted by the proposal; unsupported modes
return creation errors. See [MEDIA.md](MEDIA.md) for remaining modes and verification.

The [runtime domain registry](../packages/runtime/src/capabilities.ts) advertises
`shell`, `identity`, `storage`, `theme`, `resource`, `relay`, `outbox`, `common`,
`link`, `fs` and, in the new source milestone, `config`. Several write operations are denied by current policy; domain
presence is not permission for every operation. The upstream
[shim integration](../packages/runtime/src/prelude.ts) and
[host dispatcher](../packages/runtime/src/host.ts) are shared by web and CLI previews.

`intent` and `inc` are not advertised; the 2026-09-17 update below adds `cvm` and `webrtc`. Account sign-in and surrounding
website zaps do not automatically implement napplet identity-changing or payment
capabilities. Inventory all domains, including deployed `common` and `fs`, against
their exact proposal/SDK sources; the README alone is not a complete compatibility
matrix. Keep unsupported required capabilities visible and accurately classified.

## Configuration implications — A11

[NAP-CONFIG](https://github.com/napplet/naps/blob/448013e6d8cb8c75dce49576b3e7c0d46d960eac/naps/NAP-CONFIG.md)
defines schema-based settings with shell-owned writes, defaults, validation, snapshots
and subscriptions. Its supported JSON Schema subset is bounded, not arbitrary schema
execution; it includes registration acknowledgements, errors, secret annotations and
version hints. Prefer declared schemas where possible and retain the registration
escape hatch. The pinned Vite plugin already embeds `config.schema.json` as a
`napplet-config-schema` meta tag in signed HTML; there is no new manifest event tag.

Our design work must distinguish publication config, napplet-declared schema,
user-selected values, and provider/game rules. Specify author/account scoping,
release upgrades, reset and invalid-value handling. Reuse a single validator and
settings adapter in the CLI harness and live shell, with an example and conformance
fixtures. These are now implemented in the [shared configuration host](CONFIGURATION.md),
with fresh scopes per verified build/account and memory-only secrets. A schema
annotation must never grant a napplet access to a creator key. The compatibility
record distinguishes the upstream runner's boot checks from actual config tests.

## ContextVM implications — A14/A15

[NAP-CVM](https://github.com/napplet/naps/blob/ad68a938236e9230324e377cd005008a315ff402/naps/NAP-CVM.md)
defines direct provider discovery/requests, MCP conveniences and a host-curated
registry. Transport, encryption, correlation and provider policy stay host-owned.
Registry candidates require liveness checks, and schema identity matters when
selecting substitutes. The proposal's `value` dependency is optional for payments;
the overview's dependency column is not enough to infer mandatory payment support.

Matchmaking, rooms and presence are our separately versioned application contracts,
not new NAPs merely because they run on ContextVM. Keep the direct provider path
usable, public activity opt-in and private sessions undisclosed. Complete the bridge
and three gameplay topology examples before declaring a generalized API. Existing
[ContextVM documentation](CONTEXTVM.md) remains the starter's implementation record.

## Wider-launch acceptance still to do

1. Complete the existing operation/evidence matrix with each remaining NAP's exact
   specification revision, dependencies and per-operation conformance tests.
2. Retain the reconciled NIP-5D manifest/bootstrap and CONFIG bindings; finish the
   cross-client packaged-resource/source/preview audit across the chosen toolchain.
3. Publish with our CLI, discover and run in an independent client without our API;
   import an independent creation back. Include configurable creations when A11 ships.
4. Exercise optional/unknown requirements and malformed messages. Keep one verified
   admission/player path for every publisher, including fixtures and paid placements.
5. Review the host interfaces used by source, immersive routing, comments, settings,
   CVM sessions and flavors. Keep UI layout, media representation, identity and
   provider choice independently replaceable without an unrestricted generic RPC.

These remain launch acceptance steps. The configuration implementation does not
claim native projection support, full cross-client conformance or a production
multiplayer service.

2026-09-14 source-browser slice: no upstream protocol/runtime pin changes. The web client now consumes existing optional signed archive provenance for read-only file inspection, with the same bounded tar policy as remix. Missing archive metadata does not gate playback or standard discovery. The creator asset audit records the unimplemented large-media pipeline in [asset authoring](ASSETS.md); it does not claim new resource capabilities.

## Host account and curation update — 2026-09-15

Local A07/A20 work uses `applesauce-accounts@6.2.0` for website account sessions and
extends site policy with administrator membership and Featured order. It does not
change NIP-5D manifests, NAP permissions, artifact formats or publisher eligibility.
NIP-98 remains the admin request protocol. Saved credentials stay in the trusted
host; running napplets receive only the existing public identity notifications.
See [identity](IDENTITY.md#website-sign-in) and [moderation](MODERATION.md).

## Creator profiles and ancestry — 2026-09-15

A13/A21 add host profile pages/editing and a genealogy view. Reviewed NIP-01/24
and NIP-5A at `a2494f4f81d46684e5814a9bf35e2b1df978f955`; the selected NIP-5D pin,
35129/15129/5129 kinds, artifact verification and NAP operation inventory stay
unchanged. Current `a`/`A` parent/origin semantics are distinct from snapshot `a`
self-reference. Space’s optional exact-parent hint is used only when its signed
target verifies; incomplete ancestry remains a gap. Public key profiles and ancestry
work without Space aliases or profile metadata. Host kind-0 editing adds no napplet
signing permission and does not implement new identity-domain operations.
See [profile limits](PROFILES.md) and [genealogy](REMIXING.md#genealogy-on-napplet-pages).

## Preview media update — 2026-09-15

Reviewed NIP-92/94 and the NIP-5A `app` association at
`a2494f4f81d46684e5814a9bf35e2b1df978f955`. Optional video attachments live in the
linked software descriptor's content and `imeta` tags. The NIP-5D pin, executable
format and NAP operations remain unchanged. This is a generic NIP-92 application,
not an assertion of a dedicated cross-client trailer contract. Every publisher uses
the same adapter; missing video cannot change playback eligibility. See
[preview delivery and local evidence](PREVIEWS.md#short-video-previews--soyli-070).

## Rich comments — 2026-09-15

Reviewed [NIP-27](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/a2494f4f81d46684e5814a9bf35e2b1df978f955/27.md)
and [NIP-92](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/a2494f4f81d46684e5814a9bf35e2b1df978f955/92.md).
Kind-1111 text can display NIP-19 references and media whose optional `imeta` URL
matches its content. No new signed event kind, manifest field, NAP operation or
iframe permission is introduced. Unknown references require verified napplet
resolution before playback. Site aliases remain site-local; optional presentation
does not change interoperability. See [rich comment limits](COMMUNITY.md#rich-comment-presentation--2026-09-15).

## Runtime relay routing correction — 2026-09-15

Rechecked [NAP-OUTBOX proposal 32](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pull/32) and
[NAP-RELAY proposal 2](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pull/2) read semantics against
the existing pinned bindings. Explicit read relay hints are policy candidates;
NIP-65 author write relays can supply reads even when absent from catalog discovery.
No binding, manifest, SDK or proposal pin changed. The shared host now mediates these
reads with public destination checks, bounded filters/streams, TLS and cancellation.
Publishing remains disabled in playback. This fixes the discovery/runtime allowlist
conflation; it does not claim full outbox intelligence or publishing conformance.
See [implemented routing policy](PUBLIC-RUNTIME.md#runtime-relay-routing--soyli-082).

## Read deadline correction — 2026-09-15

The pinned outbox shim starts its `timeoutMs` timer before posting to the host.
The host previously used the same duration for discovery and collection, allowing
a stalled fallback to race the shim's timeout even with verified results in hand.
soyLI 0.8.3 and the shared web host reserve reply-delivery time inside that budget
and preserve partial-result/error semantics. No protocol fields, permissions,
SDK versions or proposal pins change. See PUBLIC-RUNTIME.md for timing limits.

## NAP-CVM / NAP-WEBRTC implementation review — 2026-09-17

Reviewed the registry and open pull requests, including
[NAP-CVM PR 31](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pull/31) at
`ad68a938236e9230324e377cd005008a315ff402` and
[NAP-WEBRTC PR 59](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pull/59) at
`5fae95dd2c8e59bd06c654e0845656add077dcda`. These remain proposal contracts with
user-selected authority; an open PR is not proof of implementation or universal
interoperability. The existing NIP-5D pin and upstream shim/creator pins remain.

The shared host now supplies their standard browser envelopes; app-facing CVM
request/discover/close/registry operations and WebRTC open/send/close/events are
implemented. The service uses ContextVM SDK 0.13.16, encrypted client identity
injection and per-tool CEP-15 hashes. CEP-41 streams and oversized transfers are
disabled; family hash equivalence, payment execution and arbitrary code are not
implemented. NAP-CONNECT/raw sockets are not a workaround for this boundary.

Backend namespaces are author-qualified addresses; provider configuration and
board rules are creator-tool metadata, never mandatory napplet manifest fields.
Native WebRTC signaling is host-owned and separately documented as `soy-rtc/1`.
The proposal does not prescribe a universal host signaling protocol. No new app
wire messages or direct sandbox network exemptions were introduced.

The soyLI 0.10.1/shared-host permission update implements the same proposal's
recommended user policy: a host popup records a browser/origin-wide multiplayer
choice, editable in Network settings. It changes no NAP messages or upstream
pins. Explicit Block persists; dismissals do not. Revocation closes active sessions.

The 2026-09-18 soyLI multiplayer lab adds only creator-side testing and host-side
diagnostics. It uses the same pinned CVM/WebRTC envelopes. Artificial delay/jitter
exists only in runner-owned browser contexts and preserves ordered delivery; the
production channel profile is unchanged. Diagnostic reports omit native candidates,
addresses, SDP and credentials. No diagnostic operation is added to the napplet API.

[ContextVM](CONTEXTVM.md) records behavior, evidence and remaining acceptance;
the self-contained [creator guide](BACKEND-CREATOR.md) ships with soyLI. These
engineering fixtures do not substitute for an isolated creator using only the
released CLI and shell, or for cross-network transport tests.

## 2026-09-18 — Git collaboration review

NIP-34 reviewed at `6d2979b3f503a8539c983efbcdcf901bbcf9ed23` against the
[official specification](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/6d2979b3f503a8539c983efbcdcf901bbcf9ed23/34.md)
and ngit's [PR guide](https://ngit.dev/pull-requests). GRASP remains pinned to
3.0.2 / `cdda4a23fe5dede2411e18aaa8b82c1747c97ddf`; its standard PR purgatory
requires target Git data, so the client pushes the signed event ref and verifies
relay read-back rather than treating an OK acknowledgement as discoverability.
Optional GRASP-06 hosting is not required or enabled by this change.

No NAP or authoritative NIP-5D pin changes. Built review reuses normal sandbox
playback with separate state and guest identity. Optional `soy-preview` is a Soy
attachment convention, explicitly documented in [COLLABORATION.md](COLLABORATION.md),
not claimed as a standardized NAP or prerequisite for external proposals.


## Managed resource authoring review — 2026-09-20

Reviewed [NAP-RESOURCE proposal 13 at `8c0645d`](https://github.com/napplet/naps/blob/8c0645d32ceb159bc3e8bcec1107a92862b7e86a/naps/NAP-RESOURCE.md),
including complete Blob results, canonical `blossom:sha256:<hex>` references, hash
verification and host MIME/policy ownership. The existing shim 0.30.0, starter SDK
0.24.4 and maintained boilerplate pin are unchanged; the NIP-5D authority/pin stands.

The new inventory/helper uses that existing resource surface. Local original serving
is an explicit loopback development adapter; publication uploads immutable bytes to
the chosen Blossom and emits ordinary server/requirement tags. The inventory does
not need an independent-client adapter for playback. The browser test decodes real
PNG/WAV/WOFF2/WebM using local and separate Blossom fixtures; the compiled upstream
Vite test rebuilds embedded/external assets in a fresh Git checkout. This does not
claim full NAP-RESOURCE conformance, arbitrary codec support, Hashtree resolution,
SVG rasterization or an independent-client acceptance test. Existing unsupported
operations remain unsupported. No protocol identity or discovery changes.

## Independent implementation review — 2026-09-20

Rechecked the [NAPS registry](https://github.com/napplet/naps) and
[open proposals](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pulls). The registry remains at
`a040914b4bbd3a5cd8a14b0f316a723c968ebfb2`; the authoritative NIP-5D PR head remains
`24711d9c47bbdd07908bf1d52bf677d9cbc530f0`. CONFIG, CVM and WEBRTC proposal pins are
unchanged. Newly listed proposals do not automatically become advertised support.

[RESOURCE PR 80](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pull/80), head
`fa6bcc6935aa19e7b70ab2a2c721dafca77c78e1`, replaces PR 13 after its merge/revert.
Compared with our selected `8c0645d`, its NAP-RESOURCE.md replaces CDDL shapes with
equivalent field tables and adds a changelog. No wire-operation or resource-policy
change was found. Retain the existing implementation pin and track PR 80 for review.

[Independent-client acceptance](INTEROPERABILITY.md) now runs Soy publications in
unmodified Paja 0.16.4 and imports independently authored fixtures with upstream
manifest builders at `956135bfc41a2cff5e45d6c68d9f9a4d68c50531`. It also fetches Soy
proposal history using ordinary Git/ngit 2.1.0. The observed `config.schemaError`
(`no-schema`) justified the 0.14.1 starter fallback: register the same embedded
schema only when the host has not supplied one. No new envelope, manifest identity,
required presentation metadata or production capability grant was introduced.

These are bounded interoperability checks, not a completed audit of all NAPs.
Paja consent policy, full upstream publishing/review UI, CONFIG edge semantics,
other providers and real-network multiplayer remain separately qualified work.

## Interactive NAP review — 2026-09-20

Selected proposal revisions for soyLI 0.15.0/shared `space-playback-4`:

| Proposal | Exact selected head |
| --- | --- |
| [FS #88](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pull/88) | `b640cf337c0481f0f9a0216c00843f797a5c6df6` |
| [UPLOAD #33](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pull/33) | `a7cc17463cbf5d9cb87884b31071bc4fc826034c` |
| [COMMON #67](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pull/67) | `de603e205a9b498f252be9a5e8e6825c4648df39` |
| [LISTS #68](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pull/68) | `72fddac5def8f9bcbedd01dd942c530d89e335e0` |

The pinned shim 0.30.0 already includes these envelopes and SDK bindings; no
upstream dependency or authoritative NIP-5D revision change was needed. NIP-02,
25, 30, 51, 56, 65 and Blossom authorization inform the event constructors.
NAP-LISTS permits policy-selected kinds/item types. The implementation advertises
public items on thirteen list kinds and preserves existing encrypted content;
private item mutation remains explicitly unsupported. Omitted remove visibility
must not silently remove only public items from a list with opaque content.

FS pickers copy into the bounded virtual session filesystem; they grant no live
OS paths. UPLOAD uses direct CORS requests and independent hash verification;
the initial correlated reply precedes asynchronous approval/transfer. COMMON
constructs constrained follow/reaction/report events through the viewer signer.
Generic relay/outbox writes and arbitrary key operations remain denied. Browser
Network settings select action relays/upload storage; signed napplet hints do
not silently override those write destinations. Proposal previews remain guests.

[Runtime actions](RUNTIME-ACTIONS.md) records limits, examples, lifecycle and
verification. Both production web player and soyLI preview were exercised with
the real pinned shim against isolated signed relay and Blossom fixtures, including
mobile approval controls. This is not independent-client acceptance or full
NAP conformance. No production deployment is part of this change.
