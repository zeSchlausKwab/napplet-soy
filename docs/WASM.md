# Rust, WebAssembly and Bevy napplets

The Rust build recipe produces the same signed, single `/index.html` artifact as
a JavaScript napplet. Players install nothing. It runs in the same opaque iframe
and uses the same host capabilities on napplet.soy and in `soyli dev`. Rustup is a
creator prerequisite, not a player prerequisite. No engine-specific starter is
required: keep an ordinary Cargo project and add the local recipe below.

## Supported boundary

- Single-threaded `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, wasm-bindgen's browser bindings and
  WebGL2. This is WASM **inside the existing web projection**, not a new NAP WASM
  projection or capability called `wasm`.
- Executable WASM, JavaScript and CSS stay embedded in one HTML file. No external
  executable modules, dynamic network imports, raw networking or worker exemption.
- 10 MiB final HTML. The build gzip-compresses WASM before base64 embedding;
  the decoded module is capped at 32 MiB. Source and
  reachable Git history each have the existing 40 MiB budget; at most 128 source
  files. The Rust linker sets a 256 MiB maximum linear memory. This is a build
  profile, not a bound on the browser's total GPU/JavaScript memory usage.
- Threads, SharedArrayBuffer, WebGPU, WASI, native OS APIs and Godot are outside
  this initial qualification. A project can choose other tools, but its result
  must still work inside the same sandbox and limits.

## Configure an ordinary Rust project

Keep normal source, Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, LICENSE and a pinned
rust-toolchain.toml in Git. Do not replace an existing project by re-scaffolding.
In its normal `napplet.json`, set `entry` to `dist/index.html` and add:

```json
"build": {
  "kind": "rust",
  "crate": "my-game",
  "target": "bin",
  "toolchain": "1.97.1",
  "bindgen": "0.2.125",
  "profile": "release"
}
```

`crate` selects the Cargo binary (hyphens preserved). For a `cdylib`, use
`target: "lib"` and its library name. The first implementation supports a package
at the project root; complex workspaces can supply a custom build recipe.
Optional `features` and `defaultFeatures` map to ordinary Cargo flags.

```toml
# rust-toolchain.toml
[toolchain]
channel = "1.97.1"
profile = "minimal"
targets = ["wasm32-unknown-unknown"]
```

Pin `wasm-bindgen = "=0.2.125"` in Cargo.toml. The CLI version and the single
wasm-bindgen version resolved in Cargo.lock must match exactly; soyLI explains
which pin to fix. Do not silently update someone else's lockfile to make a build
pass. Tested companion versions are js-sys/web-sys 0.3.102 and
wasm-bindgen-futures 0.4.75.

`soyli setup` installs the selected Rust toolchain through an existing Rustup,
adds the WASM standard library and caches that exact wasm-bindgen CLI. It creates
Cargo.lock only if absent. It does not change your default Rust toolchain or
replace your globally installed wasm-bindgen. First setup/build can take several
minutes; compiler output is visible and cancellation stops owned build processes.
If Rustup is missing, install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).
Compiling the cached wasm-bindgen CLI also needs the platform's native C compiler
and linker (for example Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS or a Linux build-tools
package). Missing prerequisites retain their compiler/linker diagnostic.

Your `index.html` is a small page template containing your canvas, inline styling,
loading/error UI and exactly one `<!-- soyli:wasm -->` marker in the body. soyLI
replaces it with the bundled bindings and embedded module. Local JS snippets from
wasm-bindgen are bundled too. No separate `.wasm` is fetched by the viewer.
The browser decompresses the embedded bytes in memory using `DecompressionStream`
(gzip); browsers without it show an update message. This opens no network or worker
permission. The loader exposes `window.soyliWasmReady`, a Promise resolving to the Rust exports
after initialization. Use it for optional HTML buttons that call exported Rust
functions; do not invent host-owned SHELL handshakes in the app.

If present, `config.schema.json` is validated and embedded using the existing
`napplet-config-schema` metadata convention. Declare mandatory NAP domains in
`napplet.json.requires`; engine choice grants no new host permission.

```gitignore
/target/
/.napplet-space/
/dist/
```

soyLI's own Rust outputs live under ignored `.napplet-space/wasm-target`, and
`.napplet-space/wasm-build.json` records module/HTML bytes, linear-memory ceiling
and build duration. Keep the template, Rust sources, lockfiles, asset originals,
schemas and helper modules in Git. Exclude caches, not the files needed to rebuild.

## Build, edit, check and share

```sh
soyli setup
soyli build
soyli dev
soyli check
soyli doctor
soyli checkpoint "Build the first playable version"
soyli publish
```

`dev` serializes rebuilds when Rust/source/template/config/asset files change. It
uses its own watcher; cargo-watch is not needed. A failed rebuild reports the
compiler's cause and keeps the last successful preview. Save a fix to retry.
Optional `build.watch` replaces the default relative source globs; include all
build inputs. Generated directories are always excluded. Restart preview after
changing build kinds. Stop your preview session when finished; never kill other
projects' Bun/Node processes to reclaim a port.

Initialization can take longer than a JavaScript app. Set `preview.readySelector`
to a DOM marker your app creates **after its scene/assets are usable**, for example
`html[data-napplet-ready='true']`. Browser checks/capture wait up to 30 seconds for
that milestone before applying `preview.delayMs`. The host handshake and successful
module compilation alone do not prove a rendered game. Missing readiness is an
actionable error, not a successful screenshot of a loading screen.

The normal publishing, remix and proposal flow is unchanged. A clone preserves
Cargo source and pins, then `soyli setup` and `soyli build` recreate the artifact.
Opening a built proposal never executes its Cargo/build scripts. Rebuild only
source you have chosen to trust. Rust build scripts/procedural macros execute on
the creator's machine, just like other build tools.

For other build tools, `build: { "kind": "command", "command": ["executable",
"argument"], "watch": ["src/**/*", "index.html"] }` runs an argument array
without shell interpolation. It must write a complete `dist/index.html`.
`timeoutSeconds` defaults to 300 (maximum 1200). `soyli setup` does not provision
arbitrary custom toolchains. Omit `build` to keep the maintained Vite workflow.

## Calling the host from Rust

The creator kit ships `docs/examples/napplet.rs`. Include it as a Rust module:

```rust
#[path = "../docs/examples/napplet.rs"]
mod napplet;
// In an async task, never block the browser/render loop:
let value = napplet::call("storage", "getItem", &["best-score".into()]).await?;
napplet::call("storage", "setItem", &["best-score".into(), "42".into()]).await?;
let settings = napplet::call("config", "get", &[]).await?;
```

The helper preserves JS receivers, synchronous exceptions and asynchronous
rejections. `domain`/`invoke` also let you bind standard callbacks and call session
objects. For CVM, use the exact request shapes in docs/napplet-backend.md and
docs/napplet-actions.md, construct JS objects (or serialize with serde-wasm-bindgen),
and await replies in local tasks. Keep game state changes on the engine update
loop; do not block on host/network responses. Preserve callbacks with Rust
`Closure` ownership and close subscriptions when leaving the scene. The helper
does not create an unrestricted host RPC or bypass user consent.

## Bevy guidance

Qualification uses Bevy **0.19.0** (the committed lock resolves its internal
crates to 0.19.1) with default features disabled and only needed
render/asset/window features plus `webgl2`. Do not turn on `default_platform`
blindly: it also includes native/clipboard/threading features. Prefer the smallest
feature set that renders your game. A general 3D project may exceed 10 MiB even if
a small 2D project fits; measure before promising support for an entire engine.
For a minimal 3D feature set without `tonemapping_luts`, explicitly choose a
LUT-free camera tonemapper such as `Tonemapping::None` or `Reinhard`. Bevy's default
AgX produces magenta output when its LUT feature is absent. The checked specimen
uses `None`; visual checks matter even when startup reports no JavaScript error.

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "s"
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
strip = true
panic = "abort"
```

Point the main `Window` at your existing canvas and enable
`fit_canvas_to_parent`. Give html/body/canvas explicit dimensions and handle
portrait layouts, touch, focus and resize. Do not assume the browser's viewport is
the iframe's size. Run representative gameplay on a phone; desktop WebGL startup
does not establish mobile performance. Keep keyboard/pointer alternatives to
gamepads. Browser audio still needs user interaction.

Bevy's default HTTP AssetReader is blocked by the sandbox. For small resources,
use `include_bytes!`/Bevy embedded assets. For managed external resources:

1. Add original assets using `soyli assets add` or the local manager. Keep its
   inventory and originals so publish/propose uploads them and remixes restore them.
2. Include `docs/examples/napplet_bevy.rs` alongside `napplet.rs`.
3. Register `NappletAssets` **before** DefaultPlugins.
4. Use `asset_server.load("napplet://<sha256>.png")` with a hash from the inventory.
   This adapter calls standard `napplet.resource.bytes("blossom:sha256:<hash>")`;
   the trusted host performs byte/hash/MIME checks and local-preview resolution.

The extension selects Bevy's loader. This flat hash reader has no directory
listing or metadata files. Compound formats with relative dependencies (such as
multi-file glTF) need an explicit mapping/asset loader or a self-contained variant;
do not fall back to raw HTTP. Current managed formats and budgets are in the
[asset guide](https://github.com/zeSchlausKwab/napplet-soy/blob/main/docs/ASSETS.md).
No compressed meshes or arbitrary binary MIME support is implied by WASM support.

## Sources and verification boundary

- [Bevy 0.19 web build guidance](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/v0.19.0/examples/README.md#wasm)
- [Bevy size optimization guidance](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup/)
- [wasm-bindgen browser loader and byte input](https://wasm-bindgen.github.io/wasm-bindgen/examples/without-a-bundler.html)

The selected NIP-5D, shim, SDK and NAP bindings are unchanged. See the
[compatibility record](https://github.com/zeSchlausKwab/napplet-soy/blob/main/docs/COMPATIBILITY.md)
for actual verification evidence; this guide is not a claim of universal engine,
mobile-GPU, independent-client or WASM-native-projection conformance.

### Reproducing the local acceptance specimen

From the soyLI source checkout (Bun, Git, Rustup and the test browser required):

```sh
bun scripts/wasm-fixture.ts .local/wasm-proof
bun run soyli setup --project .local/wasm-proof
bun run soyli build --project .local/wasm-proof
bun run soyli browser install
SPACE_TEST_WASM_PROJECT="$PWD/.local/wasm-proof" bun test tests/services/wasm.test.ts
SPACE_TEST_WASM_PROJECT="$PWD/.local/wasm-proof" bun test tests/services/wasm-publishing.test.ts
```

The second test starts disposable local relay/Blossom/GRASP services, creates test
identities, publishes, clones the Git source and rebuilds a playable proposal. It
does not publish to public services or use your saved creator account. For its
service prerequisites, use the repository's normal local development setup.
The fixture is a test specimen, not a required Bevy starter. Set its build
`features` to `["scene3d"]` and rebuild to exercise the 3D WebGL2 renderer too.
